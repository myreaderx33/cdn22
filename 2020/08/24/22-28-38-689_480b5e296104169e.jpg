United States consumer groups are now alerting parents not to buy the devices, and they&#8217;re asking the government to examine if the gadgets aren&#8217;t lawful regarding personal privacy and consumer security.<br />
The security testers could to pair an existing device with a completely brand-new account, allowing the testers to see user data, including the watch&#8217;s existing place and location history and contact phone numbers in the account&#8211; all without the watch user&#8217;s being informed.<br />

The designs tested were the Gator 2, the SeTracker series of apps and the Xplora watch. A fourth model, the Tinitell, did not have significant security flaws however likewise didn&#8217;t have clear privacy securities, the report found.<br />
The lapses the group found flaws last December in a doll called My Pal Cayla, which motivated children to talk to it and taped their statements.

<h2 class="headline"><a href="https://www.grab.by/elitebook-x360-1040-g5-the-hp-laptop-for-professionals/" rel="bookmark" title="EliteBook x360 1040 G5, the HP Laptop for Professionals">EliteBook x360 1040 G5, the HP Laptop for Professionals</a></h2>
<span class="divider-small"></span>
<p>HP launches EliteBook of a new generation, and the ambitions are clear: this laptop (HP EliteBook x360 1040 G5) business-oriented is a 2-in-1, which directly targets the ThinkPad X1 Carbon from Lenovo. And its customer base.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.grab.by/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/elitebook-x360-1040-g5-the-hp-laptop-to-divert-the-pros-of-the-thinkpad-carbon-x1-1.png" alt="" align="bottom" /></p>
<p>The latest EliteBook is one of the elements of the renewal of the range of high-end hardware from HP. The attempted seduction of HP on the fan base of the ThinkPad to Lenovo falls at the point where IDC puts the Chinese actor at the top regarding market share. And Lenovo has launched the ThinkPad Extreme X1 in August.</p>
<p>The most significant interest of the HP EliteBook x360 1040 G5 may be the screen (14 inches) in a frame of 13 inches. Yes, it is in the borderless the more advanced!</p>
<p>The HP EliteBook x360 1040 G5 also has a screen visible to the outside and a battery life of up to 17 hours. The device will be available in October from 1.499 $. On Amazon, the previous version of the EliteBook was withdrawn a week ago.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.grab.by/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/elitebook-x360-1040-g5-the-hp-laptop-to-divert-the-pros-of-the-thinkpad-carbon-x1-2.png" alt="" align="bottom" /></p>
<p>When compared to the G4, the EliteBook x360 1040 G5 is 10 percent smaller with a stunning 41 percent smaller side bezels.. The super-bright 700-nit anti-glare etched glass FHD touchscreen that made the EliteBook x360 1030 G1 so great is back for this 14-inch version. There will be 500-nit 4K UHD choices which would undoubtedly still be brighter than the displays on the majority of customer Ultrabooks. Sure Sight will certainly be readily available once more to protect proprietors from &#8220;visual hacking &#8221; when functioning in public areas.</p>
<h2>Key features of the HP EliteBook x360 1040 G5 :</h2>
<ul>
<li>Intel Core i5 or i7 processor gen8</li>
<li>Up to 2 Tb of storage</li>
<li>Up to 32 Gb of memory</li>
<li>4G LTE</li>
<li>Computer tools for the management, hardware-as-a-service and backup images.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other argument of HP is the HP EliteBook x360 1040 G5 has a smaller footprint than its predecessor. The HP EliteBook x360 1040 1040 G5 is part of a more extensive deployment of high-end devices in the framework of the strategy of HP, which aims to target the general public, users, pros, and creative.</p>

<p>Leap seconds are a phenomenon that might seem sometimes mysterious in the eyes of the profane. The idea that a minute in the course of sixty, and a second can surreptitiously slip into our clocks, has anything to be thrown so the simple quidam.</p>
<p>But it is even worse for computers : in effect the addition of a leap second is one of the events that caused the past failures are essential in a variety of computing services, the machines have not been designed to adequately account for the addition of this second, necessary to synchronize the various clocks across the world.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://www.grab.by/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/microsoft-wants-to-show-the-leap-seconds-on-windows-1.jpg" alt="" align="bottom" /></p>
<p>Microsoft has decided for its part to solve the problem in an update to Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019, which is expected to be deployed in the coming months. It should implement the support for leap seconds in Windows, that will display on the clock of the operating system.</p>
<p>In an image released by Microsoft, a gif shows how it is supported by the system, which adds a 61st second in the minute in question. <a title="" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-windows-server-2019-to-get-leap-second-support/" rel="noopener">As the note Bleeping Computer</a>, this implementation method is the most classical method. Other methods exist, like the one put in place by Google, which &#8220;spreads&#8221; the second additional counting of seconds longer to smooth the impact of this extra second.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://www.grab.by/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/microsoft-wants-to-show-the-leap-seconds-on-windows.gif" alt="" align="bottom" /></p>
<p>This update comes at a time when the regulatory framework imposes more obligation for safety-critical systems, which must be able to synchronize quickly and easily on the &#8216;official&#8217; time UTC. <a title="" href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/networking/2018/07/18/top10-ws2019-hatime/" rel="noopener">In a blog post</a> regarding the new features of measurement of time that will be added to Windows Server 2019, Microsoft explains that the technique of &#8220;spread&#8221; leap seconds lack of precision and that it has not been validated by the NIST, the American authority in charge to implement the standard.</p>
<p>The feature has yet been shown on a build Preview of Windows server 2019, without any precision on the date of the availability thereof. However, it is known that it will be extended to Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019 is expected by the end of the year 2018.</p>

<span class="divider-small"></span>
<p>Yes, the fiber optic and LED lights are now mainly used in the fields of information technology and telecommunications. But miniaturization assisting, medical applications using these technologies are in the process of development. The cochlear implants of new generation, for example, could allow the hearing impaired to listen to the music and face a lively conversation in the noise of a restaurant.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.grab.by/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/the-cochlear-implant-of-the-future-embarquerait-led-and-fiber-optic-1.jpg" alt="" align="bottom" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></p>
<p><em>Model of the human ear with an implant optogenetics (Source: Gerhard Hoch, UMG)</em></p>
<p>Nearly 500,000 people worldwide suffer from severe hearing loss and use an electronic implant to enable them to understand what is being said to their interlocutor. And cochlear implants current, provide only a partial correction of the hearing loss.</p>
<p>Impossible for the time being to those who wear them to enjoy a Mozart symphony, or gossip in the din of a crowded bar. &#8220;If they go to the restaurant (the individuals equipped with this device), it is very difficult for them to understand the discussion,&#8221; explains Tobias Moser, a neuroscientist auditory of the University of Goettingen in Germany <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/light-beam-lets-the-deaf-gerbil-hear/">at Scientific American</a>. &#8220;They also suffer from not being able to appreciate the melodies.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Optogenetics to the rescue</h2>
<p>Why ? Because cochlear implants are equipped with up to 22 channels to receive frequency. The cochlea is a spiral structure located in the inner ear. It allows the analysis of sound frequencies. A membrane vibrates at different places in response to the various frequencies found in a sound signal is identified as the language. The vibrations then activate the cell &#8220;capillaries&#8221; neighbours who, in turn, stimulate the auditory neurons, sending frequency information to the auditory nerve to the brain.</p>
<p>Sensorineural hearing loss involves loss of hair cells and the establishment of cochlear implants to bypass the damage by stimulating the neurons directly with electrodes. But the current from the electrodes tend to disperse, causing an &#8220;interference&#8221; with any electrode adjacent placed too near. As a result, the devices are designed with a number of electrode limited in order to avoid interference. So to limit the number of frequencies that can be used by the system.</p>
<p>The new study, <a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/449/eaao0540">published recently in Science Translational Medicine</a>, is using a technology called optogenetics. This technology replaces electricity with light.</p>
<h2>Genetic Manipulation on adults</h2>
<p>&#8220;The average performance with cochlear implants has capped over the last decade, so everybody&#8217;s looking for that next step,&#8221; explains the otologue Daniel Lee of the Harvard Medical School. &#8220;Optogenetics is a reasonable solution, because you can focus on the light and direct it in a way that you can&#8217;t do with electrical stimulation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Optogenetics is a research technique widely used to date in animal studies. It implies the introduction in the neurons of genes that have protein sensitive to light &#8211; the channelrhodopsins or &#8220;opsins&#8221; &#8211; allowing neurons to respond to light.</p>
<p>The researchers publishing this study had already published a paper in 2014 on the possibility to create mice that come with the opsins to the birth. For this new study, they used gerbils, who can hear frequencies lower than what humans perceive. The genetic manipulation has been carried out by researchers at of adult individuals. Specifically, they injected a virus into the cochlea of gerbils, the virus that carried the gene of the opsin in the auditory neurons.</p>
<h2>A company to commercialize the solution quickly</h2>
<p>They then used a fiber optic to transmit the light in the cochlea. With success it seems. The study has used a single channel optical and could not, therefore, measure the frequency resolution. An important step will therefore be the development of devices, multi-channel. In this perspective, <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/47/20/205401">the use of arrays of micro-LEDS could be considered</a>, as guidance technology wave, which can direct light from optical fibers. Still, of course, problems of power and management of the size of the devices to adjust.</p>
<p>And also (yes, this is not a topic to be minimal), the question of genetic manipulation in human beings. The researchers, however, indicated that on a pure technical level, the genetic manipulation caused by a virus the ears, just like eyes, are good candidates for this type of experimentation because they are less protected by the immune system and simple to isolate an anatomical point of view. This ensures that the inserted gene remains in the targeted organ.</p>
<p>The researchers plan to begin trials on primates &#8211; who have immune systems more similar to humans &#8211; this year. &#8220;We&#8217;ll probably know in about two years if we feel comfortable enough to transcribe all of this in the form of a medical device,&#8221; explains Tobias Moser. &#8220;We still have a long way to go&#8221;. However, it provides as early as next January to start a business, <a href="http://www.photonik-inkubator.de/projekte/projektdetails/optogentech/">named OptoGenTech</a>, to commercialize this technology.</p>

<span class="divider-small"></span>
<p>In the beginning of the year, Apple announced a major evolution on its Mac range : the machines were capable of supporting the graphics processors to third parties, in order to benefit from a boost of graphics performance. The support for this feature has been formalized in the month of march and some manufacturers have already begun to take advantage of this opportunity : it is the case of Razer, who has for several months of GPU-external compatible with macOS.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://www.grab.by/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/macbook-a-gpu-externally-certified-by-apple-1.jpg" alt="" align="bottom" hspace="10" vspace="5" /></p>
<p>But for the first time, Apple certifies one of these eGPU built by a third-party editor and the offers directly to the sale on his store. The eGPU Blackmagic sails a graphics card AMD Radeon pro 580 with 8 Gb of ram DDR5.</p>
<p>The device also has a connector for connecting two USB 3 ports, an HDMI port, 2.0, and two Thunderbolt ports 3. The Apple support allows this case to be compatible with Thunderbolt 3.</p>
<p>This extension is according to Apple all indicated for those who are working on applications that require lots of computing power, such as the tools for creating graphics or editing software and video editing. Apple benefits from the passage for the advise to those who would like to take advantage of a headset of VR on a Macbook Pro.</p>
<p>This extension is compatible with macOS 10.13.5 (High Sierra) and higher versions, and the device is available directly at <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HM8Y2VC/A/blackmagic-egpu">the Apple store at a price of $699</a>.</p>
<p>Of course as with anything that the apple fans will buy without question, there are the critics..</p>

<span class="divider-small"></span>
<p>It has now been a little over five years that Firefox has taken the turn and refocused the evolution of its software to make the browser fast and light that it is today. This period has allowed Firefox to get rid of the main problems with the display of web pages, which have more or less disappeared on the desktop version of the browser. On mobile, Webkit dictates that, and just look at the treatment of the Google search engine to realize that Firefox is forced to settle for lower versions.</p>
<p>At the end-the bottom of the Mozilla bug tracker is <a title="" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=975444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a ticket of bug opened in February 2014</a> and that still has not been resolved : to force Google to treat Firefox as a browser full and serve up results that are comparable to those offered in Chrome and Safari.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://www.grab.by/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/firefox-google-4-years-of-battle-to-be-considered-a-browser-full.png" alt="" align="bottom" hspace="10" vspace="5" /></p>
<p>After years of negotiations and back and forth, the problem comes to such a point that the developers of Firefox mobile have chosen to experience on their side, manipulating <a title="" href="https://miketaylr.com/posts/2018/07/google-search-in-firefox-for-android-nightly.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data from their User Agent</a> in order to push Google to identify their browser as Chrome or Safari.</p>
<p>And this is not only the search engine that provides a gradient to the users of Firefox Mobile, some services, such as Google Flight, are <a title="" href="https://twitter.com/andrewhobden/status/1007668509826928640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sometimes completely inaccessible</a> on the third-party browsers. In the last few months, I&#8217;ve used Firefox as the main browser on mobile and I could see that if the access to the service Google Flight had finally been unlocked, many aspects of the application were inevitably buggy on Firefox.</p>
<p>On the search results of Google, users of Firefox have a version reduced of the search engine Google&#8217;s flagship : it does as well not even drop-down menus to narrow a search by date. And I can hardly believe that in 2018, the web page of the most visited in the world may not be able to find the time and the resources to provide a similar experience for users browser not based on Webkit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to offer a consistent experience for all browsers and we continue to work to improve the experience of all our users. Firefox uses the Gecko rendering engine, which requires for us to test in depth each of the new features, because it doesn&#8217;t work as Webkit, the engine used by Chrome, Safari and Opera. We did this for the desktop version of Firefox, but we don&#8217;t have the same level of testing on mobile, &#8221; says a spokesperson of Google interviewed by Zdnet.com</p>
<p>It should be noted that the iOS version of Firefox, and the Firefox browser Focus both use the renderers supplied by their OS, running on Webkit. They therefore do not suffer from this problem.</p>
<p>Google has told ZDNet that Firefox was working on &#8220;a new experience&#8221; that would address all of these issues. One can hope so. Unless the european commission is interested to know why the main competitor of Chrome on the desktop is so limited on a platform officially authorising the rendering engines to third parties, and owned by Google.</p>

<p>Businesses making use of Macs have a couple options when it concerns licensing Microsoft Office software. Organizations can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/office365">purchase Office 365 subscriptions</a>, an expanding fad, including for hosted Exchange solutions. OEM licenses are an alternative, although the selection&#8217;s appeal is increasingly fading. Or, organisations can purchase on-premises (quantity) licenses.</p>
<p>Microsoft is targeting the last team with its Office for Mac 2019 commercial sneak peek, released in June 2018. Inevitably, Microsoft plans to release Office for Mac 2019 simultaneously with Office for Windows sometime in the second fifty percent of 2018.</p>
<p>Workplace 2019 for Mac will include Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and also OneNote as well as will certainly include lots of improvements for users as well as IT divisions.</p>
<p>The system&#8217;s improvements are currently readily available to Office 365 ProPlus subscribers; nevertheless, not every service prepares to move licensing to cloud versions and still seek to leverage quantity licenses. The 2019 Mac version includes a strolling pencil instance, which is the capacity to track various digital pen, pencil, and also highlighter options and also setups across numerous apps and also gadgets for users, and also ribbon modification, which allows tailoring apps&#8217; food selection settings, for all applications in the suite.</p>
<p>Each program within Microsoft&#8217;s Office collection obtains different enhancements, as well.</p>
<p><span class="img aspect-set"><img class="" src="https://grab.by/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/word-2019-focus-mode.jpg" alt="word-2019-focus-mode.jpg" width="770" /></span></p>
<p>Image: Microsoft Word receives a new Focus mode, which minimizes diversions when composing records, and also brand-new translation abilities, as well as enhanced inking utilizing a Windows Pen. Access options are additionally upgraded, consisting of a darker style, finding out device inscriptions, text-to-speech abilities, and also audio summaries for features.</p>
<p>PowerPoint packs new Morph changes, which animate motions between slides. In addition, the slide deck software application includes the capacity to insert as well as manage symbols and three-dimensional versions and also assistance for exporting 4k video clip. A brand-new play in-click sequence is likewise included.</p>

<p>Expectation has a concentrated Inbox. Developers also enabled more effective e-mail processing by adding assistance for @mentions, the capability to send messages later or on a hold-up, email design templates, and traveling and also shipment summary information.</p>
<h2>Office 2019 for Mac: What IT pros need to understand</h2>
<p>Office 2019 for Mac consists of attributes to help IT departments much better take care of implementation and also administration, as well.</p>
<p>Command-line functions aid setting up upgrade settings, while improved mobile-device management plan and also preference assistance and also compatibility are baked into the brand-new platform. These enhancements better enable IT departments to impose organization-wide safety and security policies, including for Visual Basic macros as well as application controls.</p>
<p>Organizations that wish to test the industrial preview can do so by signing up with Microsoft Collaborate. Microsoft keeps in mind that the Office 2019 industrial preview is intended for businesses that intend to release perpetual, volume-licensed, versions of Office 2019 only; mobile previews are not included in the preview program. Much more instructions for joining the Office 2019 sneak peek, as well as filling the software and also submitting comments, can be found on Microsoft&#8217;s site.</p>

<span class="divider-small"></span>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="https://www.grab.by/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/psp-mini-hero-iphone-battery_2x.png" />&#8220;Battery life&#8221; is the quantity of time your gadget runs before it should be re-energized. &#8220;Battery life expectancy&#8221; is the quantity of time your battery lasts up until it should be replaced. Make the most of both and also you&#8217;ll obtain one of the most out of your Apple devices, no issue which ones you own.</p>
<p>In this post we&#8217;re going to explain why your iPhone battery dies so fast, and the recommend 14 iPhone battery life saving tips. Now, I used to work in an Apple Store and people would come in all the time of this problem. 99% of the time, this problem is caused by the iPhone software. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the physical battery inside your iPhone. So we would always run these battery checks. They&#8217;d come back positive that the battery was okay, and then I&#8217;d show them how to do these tips and people would leave and they&#8217;d have much better battery life. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to show you howto do today. Our first battery saving tip is Push Mail:Turn push mail from Push to Fetch. So with push mail, your iPhone maintains a constant connection to your email server, and your iPhone is always asking that server,&#8221;Is their mail? Is their mail? Is there mail? Is there mail?&#8221; So instead of having that happen, we can change your iPhone from Push to Fetch. That way, we decide how often your iPhone checks to see if there&#8217;s new mail or other updates. Sure. So, how do we do that? Well first, let&#8217;s open up the Settings upon your iPhone. Scroll down to Accounts &amp; Passwords. Tap Fetch New Data. First thing we&#8217;ll do here is turn off the switch next to Push at the top of the screen. Now, how often should we fetch new data on your iPhone? And the answer is up to you. But generally, every 15 minutes is what I choose.</p>
<p>Yes. Because instead of your iPhone constantly asking the server, &#8220;Is there new mail?&#8221; we tell the iPhone to just check every 15 minutes,and that&#8217;s frequent enough for me. And you can always just open up your mail app, and then the mail will automatically fetch. Exactly. Yep. So I&#8217;ll tap every 15 minutes, that small checkmark will appear, and now you switched your mail from Push to Fetch. Well done. So, let&#8217;s go back to the main Settings menu on your iPhone. Back to accounts, back to Settings. And our next iPhone battery life saving tip is we&#8217;re going to take a look at Location Services. Now, Location Services are one of the things that makes the iPhone so great to use. It&#8217;s the GPS. It allows your iPhone to know where it isin the physical world. So I&#8217;m not saying you should turn off Location Services entirely, because that would just be a drag. Instead, we&#8217;re going to identify the Location Services that are using battery in the background of your iPhone and apps that don&#8217;t need to have Location Services turned on. Perfect. In the Settings app, we&#8217;re going to scroll down to Privacy. Privacy. And then we&#8217;re going to tap Location Services. Okay. Now as I said, you can turn off Location Services at the top. I don&#8217;t recommend doing that. Instead, I want you to look through this list of apps and identify which ones need to know where you are. Ask yourself for each app, &#8220;Does this app need to know where I am?&#8221; If the answer is no, turn off Location Services for that app. Well, I know for sure that Apple Watch Faceswap does not need to know my location, so I tapped on it, and I&#8217;m going to tap never. That blue checkmark will appear and now Location Services is not on for the Apple Watch Faces app. So in the left hand side of the Location Services Settings that you choose for each app, you&#8217;ll see these little arrows sometimes. So let&#8217;s take a look at the list of arrow sat the bottom of the screen here, and we&#8217;ll start at the bottom one. A gray arrow means that this app has used your location within the last 24 hours, and remember that that&#8217;s going to drain your battery life. So be aware of those apps. The second one from the bottom is a purple arrow, and that means that that app is using your location right now. So be careful of those apps, especially if you see that. And then there&#8217;s the hollow purple arrow,and that indicates geofencing. Geofencing is one of those Location Services features that lets your iPhone know when it has entered or when it has left a certain location. So you could say, &#8220;Hey iPhone, remind me topic up groceries when I leave work today. &#8221; And so your iPhone is going to keep track of where you are and where you work, and as soon as you leave, it&#8217;s going to remind you to go buy groceries. The problem with that is for the feature to work, your iPhone has to constantly be tracking your location at work. And so this type of Location Services; this geofencing is the number one offender in my experience of iPhone battery drain. So if you can, I recommend just not using this feature. So the last place we need to look in this part of the Settings app is under system services. So go ahead and tap on that. So here we have a list of Location Services that affect the operating system of your iPhone. For instance, compass calibration, Emergency SOS, and then there are some nefarious ones here like Location-Based Apple ads, location-based suggestions for apps, setting time zone. If you&#8217;re not traveling through different time zones, you don&#8217;t need to have this on. I recommend going through this list, and turnoff pretty much every one. I&#8217;m going to turn off Cell Network Search,right, Compass Calibration. I&#8217;m going to leave on Emergency SOS actually,in case I need that. Find my iPhone, definitely leave that in case you lose it. Home kit, I don&#8217;t need that. Location-based alerts: Those are the things when you&#8217;re going to leave work, it&#8217;ll alert you. Now, a lot of people will ask, &#8220;Does this mean my iPhone will not connect to cell phone networks?&#8221; It will still work. Great. So, Apple ads — turn that one off. Suggestions off. Motion calibration and distance? I mean, unless you&#8217;re using your iPhone as a pedometer, you probably don&#8217;t need that one. Setting time zone? I&#8217;m not traveling. Share my location? Definitely don&#8217;t want that one. Wi-Fi calling? I will leave that on, because I use Wi-Fi calling. And Wi-Fi networking? I&#8217;ll turn that one off.</p>
<h2>More Battery Drainage &#8211; Stop It</h2>
<p>Now, another place where battery drain is hiding is in Significant Locations, which used to be Frequent locations. So tap on that. Face ID confirmation. So your iPhone has the capability of tracking you everywhere you go. That&#8217;s fun. So let&#8217;s take a look at your list here. A lot of New York ones. I actually just went on a trip Upstate a little bit recently, and I got a lot of locations here. Right. But who needs it? Not me. Yeah, we don&#8217;t need to keep track of our locations. Let&#8217;s turn off significant locations entirely. Tap the switch. Now it&#8217;s off. Those locations are gone. Right. Back to system services. So here at the bottom of the menu. we see product Improvement. This is going to send data from your iPhone to Apple developers. We don&#8217;t need to be doing this. So let&#8217;s just turn off iPhone analytics, popular near me, routing &amp; traffic, and improve Maps. It&#8217;s their job to figure that stuff out. We don&#8217;t have to waste our battery telling them that stuff. So that pretty much wraps up Location Services. It&#8217;s a long step but it&#8217;s really great for your iPhone&#8217;s battery. Let&#8217;s go back to the main Privacy menu on your iPhone for the next tip. So, we&#8217;re in privacy now. Scroll down to the bottom and you&#8217;ll see analytics. Tap on that and then share iPhone Analytics:This means that your iPhone is periodically going to send data about the way that you use your iPhone to Apple and other app developers so that they can develop fixes. Not something your iPhone needs to be doing in the background, because it&#8217;s doing extra stuff; it&#8217;s draining your battery life. So let&#8217;s just go ahead and turn that off. Off. Yep. iCloud analytics? Let&#8217;s turn that off. And then all these other ones: If you set it, turn it off. Turn it off. It&#8217;s gonna save your battery life. So our next iPhone battery life saving tipis Close Out Your Apps. Now, this is kind of a controversial topic. A lot of people say it makes a difference. A lot of people say it doesn&#8217;t make a difference. As an Apple tech with experience working with hundreds of iPhones, I can tell you definitively that this does make a difference. And the reason is that sometimes apps don&#8217;t work the way that they&#8217;re supposed to. Apps are not perfect. The App Store is not perfect. Developers are not perfect. So what this does is it prevents those problems from happening. So first we need to open the app switcher on your iPhone and then close out of the app. So to open the app switcher on iPhone 8 or earlier, double press the Home button. iPhone X: swipe up from the bottom of the screen, pause in the center. So now we&#8217;re in the app switcher. iPhone 8 and earlier: swipe them up and off the top of the screen. Yep. iPhone X: Same thing. You have to press and hold first until those little red minus buttons show up, and then swipe them up and off the top of the screen. You might have 40 apps open. This is going to save your iPhone battery life, in spite of what other people say. It works. Totally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Apple’s iPhone replacement batteries are reportedly in stock without delays</h1>
<p>Our fifth iPhone battery life saving tip into turn off the Notifications that you don&#8217;t need. So Notifications are those little pop-ups that appear on your iPhone from time to time. Now, Notifications can sometimes be good,like text messages. We want to find out when people are sending us text messages, so we&#8217;ll leave Notifications on for that. However, there are other apps that may be alerting you and they don&#8217;t need to be. For Notifications to work, however, that app needs to be running in the background of your iPhone, just to pay attention to whether it needs to alert you. So by turning off Notifications for apps that don&#8217;t need to alert you from time to time, you&#8217;re gonna save battery life. So I&#8217;ll open up the Settings app, scroll down and tap on Notifications. Now take a look through your list of apps here. Ask yourself, &#8220;Does this app need to be able to notify me when something happens on my iPhone? Do I need a pop-up alert?&#8221; If the answer is no, turn off Notifications for that app. So let&#8217;s go ahead and take a look through yours. All right, let&#8217;s see. I don&#8217;t need any notification from the Mr. Time app. Yep. So when you open this menu, just turn of fallow Notifications at the top. There are ways to customize the Notifications  that you get on your iPhone, but it&#8217;s easier just to turn them all off. So just tap back to Notifications of the upper left-hand corner of the screen. Take a look through this list, and turn off Notifications for apps that don&#8217;t need to notify you from time to time. So what&#8217;s our next iPhone battery life saving tip? Next, we&#8217;re going to turn off widgets you don&#8217;t need. You can see here why it&#8217;s so <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-battery-dead-replacement-difficult-hard-2018-3">hard to replace your iPhone battery</a> in more details.</p>
<h1>What to do now if your iPhone&#8217;s battery still won&#8217;t make it through the day</h1>
<p>Widgets are the little mini apps that run on your iPhone and give a little snippet of information about what&#8217;s going on inside that app. And how do I get to see which widgets are running on my iPhone? Well, you can swipe left to right on your home screen until you reach this menu with a few widgets.I&#8217;ve got the batteries widget, ESPN widget,and the weather widget. To turn off any of these widgets, just tap that circular edit button and then tap the red minus button next to the widget you want to remove. Widgets are mini-apps. Like David just said, they&#8217;re always running in the background. By removing these, we&#8217;re cutting down on the number of apps that are running in the background of your iPhone and saving your battery life. Yeah. Just tap remove again, and then tap done in the upper right-hand corner of the screen, and that weather app widget is gone. It&#8217;s gone. Simple. So what&#8217;s our next iPhone battery life saving tip? Our next tip is to turn off your iPhone once per week. Your iPhone is a computer. It&#8217;s a little tiny computer that you carry around in your pocket. If you were to leave a computer on that&#8217;s plugged into the wall forever, it would slow down eventually. It&#8217;s important to turn off your computer and turn it on every once in a while. Same thing goes for your iPhone. How do we do it? Well, iPhone 8 or earlier, press and hold the power button until slide to power off appears. Swipe that power icon left to right to shutdown your iPhone. iPhone X is a little bit different. Press and hold the side button and the volume down button. Slide to power off appears. Slide it. Your iPhone&#8217;s off. Wait a few seconds, and turn it back on. So our next is to turn off Background App Refresh for apps where you don&#8217;t need it. Background App Refresh is kind of like Notifications but it is a little different. It allows your iPhone apps to download new content in the background, even when you&#8217;re not using your iPhone. And that uses your battery life. So let&#8217;s head to the Settings app, and then to General, and then down to Background App Refresh. Tap on that. And now, ask yourself, &#8220;Which of these apps need to be able to download new content in the background of my iPhone when I&#8217;m not using them?&#8221; A lot of them for me, honestly. I usually turn off these switches pretty much every single time. So go through the list and turn it off for almost all your apps. That&#8217;s what I do. That&#8217;s what David does. Yup. So if you would like to still go ahead and fix the battery yourself <a href="https://ifixit.org/blog/9580/fix-your-iphone-battery-yourself/">check this out</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to maximize battery performance</h2>
<p>So our next iPhone battery life saving tip is: keep your iPhone cool. Apple designed the iPhone to function most efficiently between 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 95 degrees Fahrenheit. When you start to go above 95 or below 32,you can run into problems. So just like your dog, don&#8217;t leave your iPhone in hot car. You should know that extreme heat can damage your iPhone battery permanently. And that&#8217;s no good. Cold temperatures, however, will drain your iPhone battery temporarily, but it won&#8217;t cost any permanent damage. It will come back to life as soon as it warms up. So be especially careful about hot temperatures. Our next tip is to make sure auto-lock is turned on. Auto-lock is a feature that turns off the iPhone screen after a certain amount of time. If you don&#8217;t have it turned on, your iPhone screen can stay on forever in your pocket. That&#8217;s no good. Not at all. How do we turn it off? Let&#8217;s tap back to General in the upper left-hand corner, and back to Settings. Then scroll down to Display &amp; Brightness,and then here we&#8217;ll see auto-lock. David has &#8220;Never&#8221; turned on right now, and why do you have that turned on? But he&#8217;s always careful to turn it off after we do this. I would never leave auto-lock to never in any other circumstance, except for recording YouTube videos. Never say never — except in this circumstance. So we&#8217;ll tap on Auto-Lock and just select something other than never. I usually choose two to three minutes. It&#8217;s a good balance between 30 seconds and five minutes. I&#8217;m more of a two-minute guy myself. Blue checkmark will appear. You&#8217;re all set. So our next iPhone battery saving tip is:Turn on reduce motion. Now the visual effects on your iPhone; and any gamer will tell you this; are one of the primary reasons why iPhone batteries die so fast. Your iPhone is a computer, as I said before,and it has a little graphics processor inside. And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s responsible for all those little fancy animations that happen. But every time an animation happens, it&#8217;s draining your iPhone battery. So a lot of the time, we can turn off these features and you won&#8217;t even notice a difference. So, how do we do it David? Well, we&#8217;re going to tap the back to display and brightness and back to Settings. And then we&#8217;re going to tap on General, tap accessibility, tap reduce motion, and turn on the switch next to reduce motion. You&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s on when it&#8217;s green. So David, let&#8217;s show them how it works. So I&#8217;ll swipe up and go back to the home screen. Right. And instead of having a fancy animation where the app gets swiped up and animated, it just fades into the background. It doesn&#8217;t really affect the way you use your iPhone, but it can save battery life. I usually leave reduce motion on and I have never noticed a difference. So our last iPhone battery life-saving tipis DFU restore your iPhone. Now, before you decide to do this, make sure you live at the changes that we&#8217;ve suggested for at least a few days, because a lot of the time, you will have fixed the problem just by changing these settings in the Settings app. However, if your iPhone battery still continues to die too quickly, you may have a deeply-rooted software problem that only a DFU restore can solve. A DFU restore removes everything from your iPhone and then puts it back on again. So make sure you have either an iTunes backup first or an iCloud backup. Let&#8217;s show them how to do an iCloud backupreal quick. Right. Well, let&#8217;s open up the Settings app, and go back to the main Settings page by tapping these back buttons. And then we&#8217;re going to tap on my name at the top of the screen. Obviously, it&#8217;s going to be your name on your iPhone. Unless your name is David Lynch. That&#8217;d be a coincidence. Yeah, interesting. Tap iCloud, scroll all the way to the bottom to iCloud backup. David has this feature turned off. Make sure this is turned on. Make sure that switch is turned on. Start iCloud backup? Okay. So this can take a while. iCloud backups do happen automatically, as long your iPhone is plugged in overnight, connected to Wi-Fi, and the screen is off. It&#8217;s a good feature just to have on. Yeah, and then once that iCloud backup isset, check out DFU video. So that pretty much wraps up our list of iPhone battery life saving tips. Now, what should we do if we&#8217;ve done all this stuff; we&#8217;ve done the DFU restore and we&#8217;re still having a problem? You might be in that 1% that needs their battery replaced. Go to your local Apple Store or check out Puls, an on-demand repair company. They&#8217;ll send a tech to you and replace your battery on the spot. But before you do that, make sure you&#8217;ve tried all these tips, because a lot of the time, people pay for these battery replacement sand nothing changes. It&#8217;s because it is the software that is causing this problem! Hopefully your battery is better.</p>

<p>File Grabber for Microsoft Window composed a little bit of python application earlier this year. This downloads all graphics off a 4chan thread after you mix in the LINK. This functions, I am kinda happy with it, all are effective. I have some concerns regarding getting data from internet sites.</p>
<p>Probably you want to download and install a complete website, or possibly you merely desire to download that online video that Firefox maintains opening along with a plugin as opposed to investing this to your hard disk. Whatever it is, you can easily download that rapidly by pasting its URL right into Firefox&#8217;s Download window. It isn&#8217;t the only method to install points (you might regularly right-click on the link and also pick &#8220;Save Link As,&#8221; yet this is merely another fast way to accomplish therefore without any discussions popping up or anything like that.</p>
<p>Internet Download Supervisor is among the uses I speak highly of. Sure, there are various other download supervisors for Microsoft window, but also for me, absolutely nothing is as good as IDM. Many individuals who make use of IDM could probably not be familiar along with the added functions this delivers, the significant 2 being Scheduler and Grabber. Scheduler, correct to its label, timetables downloads, as well as Grabber grabs some downloads off a website.</p>
<p>For including documents to the line, you need to click on the Download Eventually switch on the download dialog box, which seems when you click the download hyperlink. That is going to open a small drop-down menu where you choose the line through which you want the download to become included.</p>
<p>Thus, the 4chan API points out &#8220;Perform not make over one demand each second.&#8221; I reckon this counts merely for receiving the threads JSON report which contains all the graphics I.d.s? Or performs that count for each photo the app downloads? That will be difficult since the plan downloads all pictures simultaneously, none image per next.</p>
<p>File Grabber possesses a report size as well as is actually on call for download off our website. Merely click the green Download button above to start. Until now the system was downloaded 915 times. Our experts already examined that the download URL to be secure, having said that for your very own protection our team encourage that you scan the installed software program with your antivirus.</p>
<p>You can choose documents through selecting a directory or volume in the tree sight in Microsoft window Traveler or even by selecting the data in the list viewpoint window. If you choose a directory, the Directory site Documents Selection Window enables you to enter the criteria to select reports from that directory site as well as, if you yearn for, all subdirectories.</p>
